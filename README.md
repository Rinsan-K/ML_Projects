ML Projects
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate different algorithms, techniques, and applications of machine learning. Each project focuses on a unique problem domain and covers the complete machine learning workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation.

Projects Overview
Data Preprocessing: Examples of data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformations to prepare datasets for modeling.
Supervised Learning Models: Implementations of algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
Unsupervised Learning Models: Projects using clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for insights on unlabeled data.
Deep Learning Models: Neural network models for complex tasks, including image and text processing.
End-to-End Applications: Full projects demonstrating real-world ML workflows with model deployment.
